# Artist Identification From Paintings Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Introduction

This project tackles the issue of artist identification from paintings. Our aim is to accurately identify the artist of a painting using transfer learning by training different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with varying Residual Networks (ResNet). We have acquired our dataset from the Kaggle competition "best-artworks-of-all-time". Our best network achieves significantly higher classification accuracy than prior work. Our results demonstrate that CNNs are a powerful tool for artist identification and that when asked to identify artists, they are able to learn a representation of painting style.
